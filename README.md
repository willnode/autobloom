AutoBloom uses scheduled tasks to run during startup. If you move the files, you have to uninstall it and reinstall it. It will not run with battery power, in order to change that you have to [disable only run in AC power by yourself](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9075564/change-settings-for-power-for-windows-scheduled-task).
To uninstall just run `uninstall.bat`.

The program should not be detected as virus anymore, as it no longer contains compiled VB code.
